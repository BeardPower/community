# Red Community

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/red/community](https://badges.gitter.im/red/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/red/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This is a resource for Red users and members of the community. Generally that
means software developers of some kind, so you'll find information targeted
mainly at that audience. But Red can be used by anybody, for many different
purposes. You don't need to be a professional developer to use the resources
here.

As a resource repository for Red developers, you'll find scripts, tools, demos,
documenation, tutorials, and more, all contributed by members of the Red
community. It's more open than the official Red and Red Code repositories, where
people can post demos of things they've written in Red, as well as reusable
functions, libraries, and tools for others to use.
